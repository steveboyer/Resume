		\begin{rProject}{Infrared remote control system}
			Designed a system for emulating a TV remote control with an Android-based application and two external devices. An Android app running on a phone communicates with a Linux-based server over WiFi via a RESTful API designed in Python. Commands are transmitted over 433MHz radio-frequency (RF) communication to a battery-powered device containing an IR receiver and emitter. Buttons on the Android app cause the corresponding IR code to be transmitted, controlling the TV.
