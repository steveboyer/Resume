\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,} 
 
I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer, Data Connections position at Alteryx. A friend of mine, Nicholas Smith, recommended that I apply for this position, and I think I would be a good asset to your team.

%PARAGRAPH ONE: State the reason for the letter, name the position or type of work you are applying for and identify the source from which you learned of the opening (i.e. career development center, newspaper, employment service, personal contact).

%Although it is in a different field, I believe my time at the University of Wyoming makes me highly qualified for this position. As you can see from my enclosed resume, I have advanced knowledge in mathematics and some experience in chemistry. My chemistry courses and many of those in electrical engineering required the use of advanced instruments and the keeping of detailed lab notebooks. Lab reports for these courses were compiled using Excel, Word, and engineering software like MatLab. These courses also emphasized lab safety and care of equipment. Finally, working remotely at previous jobs necessitated good communication skills and time management. 

%PARAGRAPH TWO: Indicate why you are interested in the position, the company, its products, services - above all, stress what you can do for the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain how your academic background makes you a qualified candidate for the position. If you have practical work experience, point out specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat the same information the reader will find in the resume. Refer the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes your qualifications, training, and experiences. The purpose of this section is to strengthen your resume by providing details which bring your experiences to life. 

I have always been interested in data and using statistics to identify patterns. I enjoy developing software tools for others to use for increasing productivity, as I did at a previous employer. While at that employer, I worked with limited supervision and learned many new things on my own. As an example, I was required to use MySQL and Javascript while developing a web application. Both of these were relatively new to me, and I put in the effort to learn them. Please refer to my resume for a full account of my experience and qualifications.  
 
%PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and indicate your flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For example, state that you will be in the city where the company is located on a certain date and would like to set up an interview. Alternatively, state that you will call on a certain date to set up an interview. End the letter by thanking the employer for taking time to consider your credentials. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me at (307) 871-0310, so that we can arrange an interview at which my application can be discussed in greater detail. I am flexible when it comes to time and location, and would like to start working immediately.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
